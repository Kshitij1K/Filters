Filters for getting accurate data

For now, only a Linear Kalman Filter Algorithm has been uploaded

## Linear Kalman Filter Algorithm
This is a C++ implementation of the Linear Kalman Filter, designed for use with the ROS Framework. Even though the code has been written for a specific use case, it can be used anywhere with a few minor changes. It uses the Eigen library for the matrix math, so make sure you have that installed. See : [Getting started with Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html)

Please read [Bzarg's website](http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/) to know the basics of the working of the Kalman Filter algorithm.It is an excellent website and the working of the Kalman Filter has been explained pretty nicely. All the variable names used are taken from this website.

For installation and use, please check the wiki.

=======
Filters for getting accurate data.

For now, a modular Kalman Filter for ROS has been uploaded. This has been written for a specific use case, however by changing Params.yaml
and making minor changes to the callback functions, this can be implemented anywhere.
